This directory contains the code deliverables used to generate the results and findings presented in the report.
- Main.ipynb: The main notebook which includes:
  * the preprocessing steps, 
  * the cross-validation results of the final models, and
  * the code to generate the predictions of the models on the test set.
- TextPreprocessing.ipynb: A helper notebook containing functions for preprocessing strings and text features.
- HelperFunctions.ipynb: A helper notebook containing helper functions used in `Main.ipynb` and the supplementary notebooks.
- Global.ipynb: A helper notebook containing some of the constants and import statements commonly used in other notebooks.
- *.supplementary.ipynb: Supplementary notebooks for each model, containing the code for generating the relevant evidence, figures, and findings in the report. 
  * Note: Some extremely time-consuming procedures were omitted, such as some feature selection steps. A sample code and a pre-generated results file are usually used in replacement.
  * The pre-generated results can be found in the "Resources" folder, which resides in the same directory.
